This work is based on the famous _Green Bible_: Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Physical Principles and Sequence Design by Robert W. Brown, Yu-Chung Cheng and E. Mark Haacke

Additionally, the learning/ folder may contain different things I like to try.
For example, I am currently experimenting with the extended phase graph concept, so you will find a multi-pulse experiment that can simulate echo formation.

### TODO
- [ ] Fix the phase stuff because phase is related to B1 field, and modelling it as a rotation about the z axis does not make sense physically.
- [ ] In the laboratory frame, make sure simulation ends with mu vector lying along the corresponding axis as it does in the rotating frame
- [ ] Remove Update buttons and update fields after enter https://practicalmatlab.wordpress.com/2012/07/09/textboxes/
- [ ] Add plot with Mz and Mxy in both rotating and laboratory frames
- [ ] Investigate off-resonance B1
