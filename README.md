### TODO
- [ ] In the laboratory frame, make sure simulation ends with mu vector lying along the corresponding axis as it does in the rotating frame
- [ ] Remove Update buttons and update fields after enter https://practicalmatlab.wordpress.com/2012/07/09/textboxes/
- [ ] Add plot with Mz and Mxy in both rotating and laboratory frames
